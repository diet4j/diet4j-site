<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<div class="section">
 <h3>How is diet4j different from <code>exec:java</code> or <code>tomcat:run</code>?</h3>
 <p>diet4j is for production servers. It has no maven dependencies itself. It can run
    command-line applications as well. It could be fairly easily extended to cover other
    kinds of module systems as well &mdash; including simultaneously.</p>
 <p>The goal is really to provide a few foundational building blocks so that Java modules
    aren’t forever 2nd (third, fourth?) class citizens on Linux distros. Few distros ship
    any Java modules, but lots of them ship perl modules and python and node and what
    have you. We hope that diet4j could change that.</p>

 <h3>Does diet4j download code at run-time?</h3>
 <p>Currently, no. diet4j right now is the equivalent of
    a Perl @INC or C shared library path, but for Java. It's not a package manager, but
    should nicely interact with one: a package manager could put various modules into
    <code>/var/lib/java</code>, and all apps using diet4j will pick up the modules they
    need from there without having to do any additional work.</p>
 <p>However, dynamic code download could be easily added if people thought diet4j
    should do that.</p>
