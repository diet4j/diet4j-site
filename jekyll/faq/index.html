<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<div class="section">
 <h3>How is diet4j different from <code>exec:java</code> or <code>tomcat:run</code>?</h3>
 <p>diet4j is for production servers. It has no maven dependencies itself. It can run
    command-line applications as well. It could be fairly easily extended to cover other
    kinds of module systems as well &mdash; including simultaneously.</p>
 <p>The goal is really to provide a few foundational building blocks so that Java modules
    arenâ€™t forever 2nd (third, fourth?) class citizens on Linux distros. Few distros ship
    any Java modules, but lots of them ship perl modules and python and node and what
    have you. We hope that diet4j could change that.</p>

<div class="section">
 <h3>Does diet4j download code at run-time?</h3>
 <p>Currently, no. diet4j right now is the equivalent of
    a Perl @INC or C shared library path, but for Java. It's not a package manager, but
    should nicely interact with one: a package manager could put various modules into
    <code>/var/lib/java</code>, and all apps using diet4j will pick up the modules they
    need from there without having to do any additional work.</p>
 <p>However, dynamic code download could be easily added if people thought diet4j
    should do that.</p>

<div class="section">
 <h3>Just how exactly do I run diet4j-based server apps using jsvc?</h3>
 <p>There's a <code>systemd.service</code> file
    <a href="https://github.com/diet4j/diet4j/blob/master/diet4j-jsvc/systemd.service.README">in Github</a>,
    which shows you both how to start and stop the jsvc-based diet4j daemon. To use it
    with systemd, replace the various <code>FIXME</code> tags with the name of the
    diet4j root module, the location of the PID file and so forth. To try it out,
    use <code>diet4j-examples-activate</code> as the root module. Save this file into
    one of the recognized systemd service file locations on Linux (such as
    <code>/etc/systemd/system/mytest.service</code>),
    invoke <code>systemctl daemon-reload</code> to have systemd pick it up, and
    start your daemon with <code>systemctl start mytest.service</code>. If everything
    works as it is supposed to, this will log the activation and deactivation in the
    system log (see <code>journalctl</code>) because that's all that the example
    module <code>diet4j-example-activate</code> does.</p>
 <p>If you do not use systemd, use the equivalent of the start and stop commands
    in your environment.</p>
