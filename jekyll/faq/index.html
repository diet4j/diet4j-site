 <h3>How is diet4j different from <code>exec:java</code> or <code>tomcat:run</code>?</h3>
 <p>diet4j is for production servers. It has no maven dependencies itself. It can run
    command-line applications as well. It could be fairly easily extended to cover other
    kinds of module systems as well &mdash; including simultaneously.</p>
 <p>The goal is really to provide a few foundational building blocks so that Java modules
    arenâ€™t forever 2nd (third, fourth?) class citizens on Linux distros. Few distros ship
    any Java modules, but lots of them ship perl modules and python and node and what
    have you. We hope that diet4j could change that.</p>
