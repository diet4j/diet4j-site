diet4j 0.13 wasn't a public release, but 0.14 is, and it is available now. Here
are the major changes since 0.12:

* Using new module ``diet4j-jsvc``, it is now straightforward to create
  server-side apps consisting of diet4j modules, without using an application server,
  and using the Apache ``jsvc`` daemon as the main program. An example
  ``systemd.service`` file is provided.

* Added ``PKGBUILD`` file to make it easier to install and upgrade diet4j on
  ``pacman``-based Linux platforms, such as
  <a href="http://archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> and
  <a href="http://ubos.net/">UBOS</a>.

* More clearly distinguish between run-time dependencies and other dependencies
  in API and implementation; avoid attempting to resolve dependent modules
  that aren't needed at run-time.

* When a class cannot be found, add to the message of the
  ``java.lang.ClassNotFoundException`` which diet4j module threw the exception.

* More output options for ``diet4j-status``.

* Better debug-level log messages.

* Various smaller bug fixes.

Happy dieting!
