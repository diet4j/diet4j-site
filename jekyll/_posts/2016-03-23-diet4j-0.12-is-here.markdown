diet4j 0.12 has been released. Some major improves were made in this release:

* Support for maven's version ranges of dependent modules.

* diet4j's ClassLoader now knows how to create java.lang.Package instances from
  the MANIFEST.MF. This allows it to handle recent versions of the MySQL/J
  connector, which (inexplicably) seem to depend on such.

* diet4j now correctly handles .war files which store their classes inside
  WEB-INF/classes, not at the root of the archive like .jar files do.

* Better argument parser for the command-line boot loader.

* Better matching of modules in the same version, if multiple versions of the
  same Module are available.

* Improved error messages in some places.

Happy dieting!
