diet4j 0.10 has been released. There's one major enhancement in this release:

* It's now possible to look up Modules just by artifactId without needing to know
  the groupId as well. This makes it easier to look for functionality of a certain
  kind, regardless of who developed or forked it, as long as it is in the
  repository.

In addition:

* More sane exceptions are thrown when looking up a Module that supposedly has only
  one resolution candidate, but it turns out it has zero or two or more. For that,
  there's new exception NoModuleResolutionCandidateException.

That's it! Happy dieting!

Cheers,



Johannes.
